    <h3>
        Wolfenstein: The New Order is a 2014 action-adventure first-person shooter video game developed by MachineGames
        and published by Bethesda Softworks. It was released on 20 May 2014 for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4,
        Windows, Xbox 360, and Xbox One. The game is the seventh main entry in the Wolfenstein series, set in an
        alternate history 1960s Europe where the Nazis won the Second World War. The story follows war veteran
        William "B.J." Blazkowicz and his efforts to stop the Nazis from ruling over the world. The game is played
        from a first-person perspective and most of its levels are navigated on foot. The story is arranged in
        chapters, which players complete in order to progress. A morality choice in the prologue alters the game's
        storyline; some characters and small plot points are replaced throughout the two timelines. The game
        features a variety of weapons, most of which can be dual wielded. A cover system is present. Development
        began in 2010, soon after id Software gave MachineGames the rights for the franchise. The development team
        envisioned Wolfenstein: The New Order as a first-person action-adventure game, taking inspiration from
        previous games in the series and particularly focusing on the combat and adventure elements. The game
        attempts to delve into character development of Blazkowicz, unlike its predecessors—a choice from the
        developers to interest players in the story. They aimed to portray him in a heroic fashion. At release,
        Wolfenstein: The New Order received generally positive reviews, with praise particularly directed at the
        combat and the narrative of the game. Critics considered it a positive change to the series and nominated it
        for multiple year-end accolades, including Game of the Year and Best Shooter awards from several gaming
        publications. A stand-alone expansion, Wolfenstein: The Old Blood, was released in May 2015 and is set
        before the events of the game. A sequel, Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus, was released in October
        2017.

    <h3>
        Gameplay
        Wolfenstein: The New Order is an action-adventure and first-person shooter video game played from a first-person
        perspective. To progress through the story, players fight enemies throughout levels.[1] The game utilizes a
        health system in which health is divided into separate sections that regenerate; if an entire section is lost,
        players must use a health pack to replenish the missing health.[2]


        Players use melee attacks, firearms, and explosives to fight enemies, and may run, jump, and occasionally swim
        to navigate through the locations. Melee attacks can be used to silently take down enemies without being
        detected. Alternatively, players can approach enemies in direct combat, which often results in an intense
        firefight between the two parties.[3]

        A cover system can be used in combat as assistance against enemies. Players have the ability to lean around,
        over, and under cover, which can be used as a tactical advantage during shootouts and stealth levels.[4] The
        game gives players a wide variety of weapon options; they can be found on the ground, retrieved from dead
        enemies, or removed from their stationary position and carried around.[5] Weapon ammunition must be manually
        retrieved from the ground or from dead enemies.[6] Players have access to a weapon inventory, which allows them
        to carry as many weapons as they find. With some of these weapons, players have the ability to dual wield,
        giving them an advantage over enemies by dealing twice as much damage.[3] Players can customize weapons through
        the use of upgrades; for example, a rocket launcher can be attached to the side of an assault rifle, and a wire
        cutting tool can be upgraded to a laser gun.[7]

        Synopsis
    </h2>
    <hr>
    <h2>Setting and characters</h2>
    The New Order is set in an alternate universe where Nazi Germany have managed to deploy advanced technologies,
    enabling them to turn the tide against the Allies and ultimately win World War II. Its storyline is loosely
    connected to 2009's Wolfenstein and features returning characters Kreisau Circle leader Caroline Becker (Bonita
    Friedericy) and SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer Wilhelm "Deathshead" Strasse (Dwight Schultz), the nemesis of series
    protagonist, U.S. special forces operative Captain William "B.J." Blazkowicz (Brian Bloom).[5][8][9] The New Order
    has a branching narrative: during the prologue chapter, Deathshead forces Blazkowicz to decide the fate of one of
    his comrades. The player's choice as Blazkowicz will create two timeline versions of the game's storyline, where
    alternate characters are established as replacements for characters who otherwise would have significant roles in
    the plot.[10]

    After the prologue chapter, either Scottish pilot Fergus Reid (Gideon Emery) or U.S. Army Private Probst Wyatt III
    (A.J. Trauth) survives and escapes Deathshead's compound.[10] Blazkowicz suffers a severe head injury during the
    escape attempt and lapses into a persistent vegetative state. He is brought to a psychiatric asylum in Poland, where
    he is cared for by its head nurse Anya Oliwa (Alicja Bachleda), and her parents, who run the facility under the Nazi
    regime. Blazkowicz watches as Anya's parents are regularly forced to hand patients over to Nazi authorities, who
    deem them Untermenschen for their mental disabilities and take them to Deathshead for unknown experimentation.[11]
    Blazkowicz and Anya enter into a romantic relationship throughout the game's narrative.[12]

    Other major characters include Frau Engel (Nina Franoszek), the Commandant of an extermination camp in northern
    Croatia known as Camp Belica; Set Roth (Mark Ivanir), a member of a Jewish mystical secret society known as the
    Da'at Yichud who is incarcerated at Camp Belica; Bombate (Peter Macon), a Namibian prisoner of Camp Belica who
    assists Blazkowicz; and Max Hass (Alex Solowitz), a seemingly brain-damaged member of the Resistance who is looked
    after by former Nazi member Klaus Kreutz (Ken Lally).[13]
    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <h3>In July 1946, Blazkowicz and his comrades take part in an air raid against a fortress and weapons laboratory run
        by Deathshead but are captured and brought to a human experimentation laboratory. Blazkowicz escapes from the
        laboratory's emergency incinerator, although he is severely injured. He is admitted to a Polish psychiatric
        asylum where he remains in a catatonic state. In 1960, the Nazi regime orders the asylum to be "shut down" and
        executes Anya's parents when they resist. Blazkowicz awakens from his vegetative state and eliminates the
        extermination squad before escaping with Anya.[11] Blazkowicz and Anya drive to her grandparents' farm, where
        they inform him that the Nazis had defeated the United States in 1948 and that the members of the ensuing
        anti-Nazi Resistance have been captured. Blazkowicz interrogates a captured officer from the asylum, learning
        that the top members of the Resistance are imprisoned in Berlin's Eisenwald Prison. Anya's grandparents smuggle
        her and Blazkowicz through a checkpoint in Stettin before they travel to Berlin. During the train ride,
        Blazkowicz encounters Frau Engel for the first time.[12] When they arrive, Anya helps Blazkowicz break into
        Eisenwald Prison, where he rescues the person he spared fourteen years prior (Fergus or Wyatt)[14] and finds
        that the Resistance movement is led by Caroline, who was left paralyzed due to an incident at Isenstadt in
        2009's Wolfenstein.[15]

        The Resistance executes an attack on a Nazi research facility in London, bombing their operations base, and
        stealing secret documents and prototype stealth helicopters.[16] The documents reveal the Nazis are relying on
        reverse-engineered technology derived from the Da'at Yichud, which created such inventions as energy weapons,
        computer artificial intelligence, and super concrete; however, it is revealed that someone is tampering with the
        super concrete's formula, making it susceptible to mold deterioration. The Resistance discovers a match with
        Set, who is imprisoned in Camp Belica.[17] Blazkowicz agrees to go undercover inside Camp Belica and meets Set,
        who tells him that the Nazis have co-opted Da'at Yichud technology to mass-produce and control robots, and
        offers to help the Resistance in return for the destruction of the camp. Blazkowicz finds a battery for a device
        that controls Camp Belica's robots, which he and Set then use to incapacitate Engel, destroy the camp, and
        liberate its prisoners.[18]

        Set reveals that the Nazis' discovery of one of the Da'at Yichud caches, which included advanced technology
        centuries ahead of its time, allowed Germany to surpass the Allies in military might. Set agrees to assist the
        Resistance by revealing the location of one such cache but states that the Resistance requires a U-boat to
        access it.[19] Blazkowicz obtains a U-boat but discovers that it is the flagship of the Nazis' submarine fleet,
        and is equipped with a cannon designed to fire nuclear warheads, which requires keycodes from the Nazi lunar
        research facility to operate.[20] Blazkowicz uses the Spindly Torque—a Da'at Yichud spherical device capable of
        destroying super concrete—to steal the identity of a Nazi lunar scientist and infiltrate the Lunar Base.[21] He
        succeeds at obtaining the keycodes, but upon returning to Earth, he discovers that Engel has mounted an assault
        on the Resistance base, capturing some of its members on behalf of Deathshead.[22]

        The Resistance use the Spindly Torque to break open Deathshead's compound. After liberating the compound's
        captives, Blazkowicz travels to the top of the tower, where Deathshead's workshop is located. Inside, Deathshead
        reveals to Blazkowicz that he possesses the preserved brain of the soldier Blazkowicz chose to die, putting it
        in a robot. The robot comes alive and assaults Blazkowicz, who defeats it, destroys the brain, and puts his
        friend to rest. Commandeering a larger robot mecha, Deathshead attacks Blazkowicz, who gets the upper hand and
        destroys the robot. He drags Deathshead out of the wreckage and attacks him, who pulls out and arms a grenade
        which kills himself and gravely wounds Blazkowicz. As he crawls towards a window, Blazkowicz mentally recites
        "The New Colossus" as he watches the Resistance survivors board a helicopter. Believing they have reached
        safety, Blazkowicz gives instructions to fire the nuclear cannon.[23] After the credits, a helicopter is heard
        approaching.[5]</h3>
